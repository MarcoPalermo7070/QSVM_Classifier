Abstract:

This research tackles the topic of _Quantum Machine Learning_, the application of quantum devices to the field of Computer Science that allows computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. I have decided to investigate this sector because I believe quantum technology will be game-changing in the near future, so that keeping up with it is crucial for any data scientist. The goal of this work is to understand how Quantum Computing can help carry out Machine Learning techniques, by using a classical-quantum hybrid model to speed-up computations. This paper, divided in four section, starts by giving a general introduction on the theory behind the Quantum Computing technology. Then it describes the state of the art of the quantum hardware and software, providing examples of the latest improvements in both fields.

Finally, in the last section of the thesis, I deliver my own implementation of a quantum Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier. In order to learn how to implement algorithms that run on a quantum device, first I studied the literature on kernel methods and quantum-enhanced supervised learning techniques, then I implemented the algorithm, using the _Python_ programming language and the _Qiskit_ library, an open source software development kit for quantum research, provided by _IBM_.

The algorithm obtains an accuracy that is lower than modern classifiers used on mainstream computers. This is because the code provided by IBM only supports data with at most three features, so that I had to reduce the dimensionality of the datasets before feeding it to the QSVM. Taking into account this limitation, the classifier achieved very good result on the datasets, but hopefully with the introduction of more powerful quantum devices in the upcoming years, there will be a tremendous spike in the performance of the algorithm.

Acknowledgments:

I would like to express my gratitude to the three amazing mentors who helped me with this work, I dedicate my thesis to them, with great respect and appreciation.

First of all, I warmly thank Professor Emanuele Borgonovo, Director of the Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Economics, Management and Computer Science, for giving me the true honor of being my Supervisor and for teaching me the basic skills to undertake this work.

Special thanks go to Co-supervisor Professor Alessandro Rezzani, senior Business Intelligence consultant, specialized in predictive analytics and big data applications, who supported me with great availability and professionalism during all the phases of my thesis. Without his precious help and guidance this work wouldn&#39;t exist.

Finally, I would like to express my deepest thanks to Professor Pierpaolo Marturano, CEO &amp; Founder of _dotQuantum_ and great expert on Quantum Computing, who gave me a lot of advice and practical suggestions.

All the people mentioned above played a really important role, but any error or inaccuracy is to be attributed to me only.
